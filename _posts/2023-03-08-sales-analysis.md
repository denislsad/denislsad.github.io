# Life Expectanct at Birth
I used data from the World Bank on life expectancy along with other parameters (mortality, diseases, etc.) for every country every year from 2000 to 2015. This data is quite a mess. For example, the GDP column is measured in many different units, so it is completely unusable, or the column names are broken.

There are no analytical conclusions at the end, as all the findings are quite obvious. The sole goal of this project is to apply my knowledge in data cleaning and visualization, as well as try to write a good-looking and reader-friendly notebook.
