Hello, my name is Denislam. I'm a self-taught data analyst with focus on Python. On this portfolio website, you can find my selected projects on a variety of subjects â€“ from politics to digging into personal data. If you have any questions/comments about my work, feel free to contact me. I would like to hear any remarks and suggestions. Also, I'd love to collaborate with others in the field of data analysis.
